            I had the pleasure of working alongside Ali at KM.ON GmbH as Project Manager on several shared projects and initiatives where his broad technical expertise, availability and reliability stood out. Even when managing multiple complex projects, he consistently navigated challenges with confidence and ensured smooth progress, making him an essential asset to our work.
